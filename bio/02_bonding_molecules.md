# Chemical Bonding/Molecular interactions

* 6 elements 98% cell mass: h, c, n, o, p, s
    - transition metals (enzyme catalysis): Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn
* Carbon
* Water
* Macromolecules
    - Carbs (Glucose), Amino acids (Methioninie), Nucleotide (Adeninie),
      Proteins
    - Lipids: Cell matrix (Super molecular phospolipids)
* Units: 10 Angstrongs = 1nm

## Biochemistry: Covalent/non-covalent boding

* Covalent are harder bonds (structure and framework) - sharing of electrons
    - globular structures
* Non covalent bonding gives us dynamics (dna duplex, folding proteins)
    - easily breakable as long as we can replace the broken bond
    - polymers are formed via covalents
* Printing a 3d model of a protein
* Carbs: signaling, energy, extra cellular matrix
* Lipoid bylayer surrounds all cells - how did this evolve?
* Cells only exist because of the "media" in which to concentrate chemicals

## HCNOPS

* Love to make covalent bonds
    - Shared pair of electrons that lead to neutrality
    - lone pairs of electrons: Nitrogen has 1, oxygen has 2
        a. How is it neutral with lone pairs?
        b. What makes charged state carbon high energy?

## Covalent Bonds

* Why HCNOPS? because they love to make covalent bonds
    - Carbon neutral when it has 4 covalent bonds even though it has 4 electrons
      in its outer shell because each electron is in a different orbital
* Lone pairs are electrons in the same shell in different orbitals
* Neutrality comes from having these valence electrons residing in different
  orbitals
* Lone pairs are sites of hydrogen bonding
    - The lone pairs only pick up a proton at higher ph levels (most bio is at
      ph 7-ph 8 it picks up a proton). Meaning it donates an electron to a bond,
and the proton for that orbital is unbalanced

## Pairing

* Electrons can only access certain energy levels
* At a given level, they have to maintain a certain angular momentum
* Typically in an orbital, the angular momentum generated by the proton
  attration is insufficient
* The additional angular momentum comes from the repulsion of a pair electron
* When they have enough angular momentum, they can remain stable without getting
  sucked into the nucleus
* A -ve charge means it wants a hydrogen, a +ve charge means it wants to get rid
  of a hydrogen (to form an electron pair)

### Typical states in covalent bonds

* Stable: H(1), C (4), N(3, 1p), O(2, 2p), P(3, 1p), S(2, 2p)
* Neutral: CH4, NH3 (1), H2O (2)
* Charged: NH4+ and H3O+/OH- via hydrogen bonding
* Sulphur copies oxygen
* Phosphorus is typically found with oxygen

### Functional groups in bio molecules

* Functional groups is where the action is
    - Bonds are lower energy than typical covalent bonds
* Hydroxyl group
```
R - OH (ethanol: Ch3Ch2-OH)
```
* Carboxyl group -> Ester (anionic form is more common)
```
     =O          =O
R - C   ->  R - C
     -OH         -O-
```
* Amino -> Amine (cationic form is more common)
```
    H            H
    |            |
R - N   ->   R - N - H+
    |            |
    H            H
```
    - Amines and Carboxyls often form electrostatic bonds
* Phosphate
    - combines with an alcohol (R-OH) to give off water (condensation)
* Sulfhydryl -> Anionic form is more common (gives up a proton)
```
R - SH  -> R - S-
```

#### Composite groups

* Protein Peptide: Amide condensation
```
                        H2O
                = O            H
R - NH2 + R - C         -> R - N - C - R
                - OH               ||
                                    O
```
    - Nitrogen in amide is neutral, but hydrogen can form H bonds

* Lipid Esther: Carboxyl condensation
```
                        H2O
              = O
R - OH + R - C          -> R - O - C - R
              - OH                 ||
                                   O
```

* Phosphate Esther: Phosphate condenstaion with an alcohol
```
    O                    O
    ||                   ||
O - P - OH + R-OH -> O - P - OR
    |                    |
    OH                   OH
```

## Non-Covalent bonds

* Covalent (CH or CO) bonds are at 90-100 kcal/mol (hard to break for biology)
* Non-covalent (nucleic acid) bonds are at 1-10 kcal/mol (dynamic structures)
    - gradual bonds and substrates that liberate products
    - low energy barriers just need catalysts

* Ionic bond (between +/-) (salt bridge, electrostatic)
    - Eg between N and O (N being +ve and O being -ve)
    - In a hydrophobic environment they charge at each other
    - In water they have to give up their soluability to reach one another
    - Energy is variable

* Hydrogen bonds
    - Between Hydrogen and -ve elements that are kind of neutral (O, N, S)
    - OH, NH, SH will donate their hydrogens
    - CH will never donate Hydrogen
    - Hydrongen bond acceptors: anything with a lone pair
    - Carbonyl (::O=C), Hydroxyl (::OH), Nitrogen unprotenated (:N)
    - Proteins are made up of amid bonds that get their 3d shape from H bonds

* Hydrophobic interactions
    - Most times when proteins fold it happens in water
    - Most of these are bonds made _with_ water (hydrophilic)
    - To get the protein to fold we need to separate the water
    - This happens by collapsing hydrophobic compounds together

* Vander Waals Forces
    - Low energy reactions between slightly charged bonds (weak dipoles)


## Macromolecules

### Lipids

* Very rich in CC and CH bonds
* Very hydrophobic
* No functional groups
* Functions
    - Triglycerides store energy: 1:2 glycerol:fatty acids
    - Steroids hormones
    - Retinol vitamins
    - Phospholipids

* Retinal binds to proteins in the eye, their shape changes with light
* Fatty acids: hydrophobic body, hydrophilic tails
    - Amphipathic (both phobic and philic, ie hydro and lipo philic)
    - Transfat - bad, cis fat - good (nut and fruit oils)

* Coronary heart disease
    - cholestrol in membranes are also used for signaling and needed everywhere
    - Only moves in body via lipo proteins (hydrophobic) which bind to
      cholestrol
    - High density lipoproteins move freely, low density lipo proteins stick to
      blood vessels
    - Saturated/trans fats bind to LDLs, the more of them you ingest the more
      clogged your arteries get (they trigger production of LDLs)
    - Saturated fats have a kinked shape because of the Carbon double bond,
      which unsaturated fats (cis fats) lack

* Esters and phospoesters of fatty acids (glocerol based phospho lipids) self
  assemble into supra molecular structures
    - hydrophobic tails on the inside, hydrophilic heads on the outside so they
      can interact with water

## Readings

### 2.1-2.4

#### 2.1

* Bohr model: nucleas = proton+neutron, surrounded by electron
    - most of mass concentrated in proton
    - most of space taken up by orbit
* CHOPSIN
* Atomic numbers = number of protons in nucleus
* Mass number = protons + neutrons (mass number ^ H _ atmoic number)
* Isotopes: same protons but different neutrons
    - radioisotopes: unstable isotopes, radiate energy which can be traced with
      a Geiger counter.
* Orbitals only denote probabilisitic locations.
* Electron pairs: 1 orbital max 2 electrons.
* Shells = collection of orbitals. second shell = s + 3 x p (x,y,z) = 8e.
* Stable atoms have even electrons in their outermost (valence) shell

#### 2.2

* Atomic wt = no. protons = no. electrons
* Molecular wt = sum of atomic wt
* Mole = numeric gms that're equal to molecular wt = protons in molecule grams
* Electronegativity: nuclear force exerted by atom on electrons
    - polar => one atom is a lot more electronegative than the other and hence
      pulls shared electrons towards it.
    - Water is polar. The Hs gain +ve charge because they basically loose an
      electron. The Oxygen is negative because they pull all the electrons.
    - Differences in electronegative potential give rise to ionic bonds
* Ionic bonding = donation of electrons
    - cation: more protons than electrons, +1
    - anion: more electrons than protons, -1
    - Stable compunds form by gaining electrons to create bonds (eg: SO4(2-)
      won't happen without gaining a charge)
* When a polar liquid like water (with strong covalent bonds that have charges)
  is mixed with a ionic bonded (still polar)compound like NaCl, the polar water
molecules pull apart the Na and Cl atoms.
    - Hydrogen bonds can form between water molecules also
    - Hydrogen bonds are special because hydrogen is so weak in its attraction
      of its electron that it easily induces polarity in its compounds
    - This makes water immescible with non polar compounds because it'd rather
      bond with itself
    - Non polar compounds can attract each other through Van Der Waals forces.
      Brief interactions between random variations in electron distribution.
* Atoms are not always stable even when protons = electrons
    - the proton charge is distributed over area, if the outer most shell has
      fewer electrons than needed to absorb all proton charge distributed at
that radius, the atom is "positive".

#### 2.3

* Breaking bonds during a reaction releases energy harvested by cells

#### 2.4

* Polar molecules are attracted to charges in other polar molecules
* Water gets its structure from hydrogen bonds
    - tetrahedral shape because of repulsion of electrons closer to Oxygen
    - ice is less dense than water, water is continuously re-forming H bonds
    - the number of H bonds that need breaking give it a high heat capacity
* Water can easily ionize (release H+ ions) which makes it a crucial medium for
  chemical reactions
* Mole = gms of 6.023 * 10^23 molecules of a compound
* Acids: release H+
* Bases: Accept H+
* Biological compounts with COOH tend to release H+
* Weak acids don't fully ionize in water (i.e don't release all the H+ from the
  entire solution)
    - Or they do ionize, but some reverse the reaction by reforming their bonds
* Water ionizes into both an acid and a base: H2O + H2O => H3O+ + OH-
* Ph just measures the -ve log of H+ concentration
* Ph of biological tissue is crucial to triggering or stopping reactions because
  of the presence of extra H+
* Buffers are used for homeostasis: even when large acids/bases added they
  maintain ph
    - Combine a weak acid and weak base such that the base absorbs H+ and
      becomes the weak base and viceversa
    - Take a weak acide, ionize it by removing a hydrogen, eg: H2CO3, HCO3-

### 3.1 & 3.4

* Macromolecules: polymers with molecular wt > 1000gm
    - Polymers are made up of monomers
    - Some monomers are functional groups that repeat in many bio molecules
    - Local sites of Macromolecules take on the properties of functional grops

* Retinal - central to vision
* Triglyceride: Glycerol + 3 fatty acids (all composed of C, O, H)
```
              H                        H
        H2C - C - CH2 -> 3H2O -> CH2 - C - CH2
        |     |    |             O     O    O   |
        OH    OH   OH            CO    CO   CO  |   Ester linkage
        OH    OH   OH
        CO    CO   CO
        3 fatty acids
```
* Carbon has a tendency to form double bonds with itself due to 4 valence
  electrons
    - Saturated: Single bond COH fatty acid
    - Unsaturated: Double bond COH fatty acid
* Phospholipids form membrane bilayers: phobic tails point at each other on the
  inside of the membrane, philic heads point at water on the outside.
